   - Update responses for interview questions

4. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   # Visit: http://localhost:5000
   ```

5. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   python deploy.py deploy
   ```

### 🎯 Interview Talking Points

- Unit tests with mocking
- Clean, readable Python code
- Type hints and docstrings

**User Experience**:
- Multiple interaction methods (voice + text)
- Real-time feedback and status updates
- Responsive design for all devices
- Graceful error handling

**Deployment & DevOps**:
- Environment-based configuration
- Automated deployment scripts
- Health check endpoints
- Production-ready settings

### 📝 Sample Questions It Can Answer

- "What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?"
- "What's your #1 superpower?"
- "What are the top 3 areas you'd like to grow in?"
- "What misconception do your coworkers have about you?"
- "How do you push your boundaries and limits?"
- "Tell me about a challenging project you worked on?"

### 🎨 UI Features

- **Professional Design**: Clean, interview-appropriate interface
- **Voice Controls**: Click to speak, automatic playback
- **Sample Questions**: Pre-loaded common interview questions
- **Real-time Status**: Loading indicators and error messages
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile

### 🧪 Testing & Quality

- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
